Every blog post I've tried to write in the last year has started from
a simple idea and gradually expanded in scope until I'm left with a
sprawling epic that I know no one will ever read and I will never
bring myself to publish. So here's something different. This isn't so
much a blog post as a wiki entry. I'm allowing myself to edit it at
any time, which alleviates some of my publishing-related anxiety.

Here are my notes to myself on how to play sysadmin in a cloud
environment.

* Inspecting a machine

Sometimes you'll SSH in to an unfamiliar environment and need to get
the lay of the land quickly in order to start debugging. We'll start
with a 1000-foot view before zooming in.

** Who else is here?

Whenever I get paged because of an anomalous resource usage pattern on
a box (e.g., the disk is nearly full, CPU or memory usage are spiking,
etc.), the first thing I do is use =w= to check for humans doing silly
things.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session none :results output :exports both
w
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:  07:05:33 up 1 day, 5 min,  3 users,  load average: 0.16, 0.28, 0.52
: USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
: astahlma tty7     :0               Mon07   24:04m  2:15   0.28s /usr/bin/lxsession -s LXDE -e LXDE

: astahlma pts/5    tmux(3208).%1    Mon08   22.00s  0.72s  0.72s -zsh

Thankfully I'm all by my lonesome here on my laptop.

** Which are the most expensive processes?

=top= is the most popular tool for getting a high-level overview of
system resource consumption for each process. But if you have sysadmin
access on the machine then you should install =htop=, which is like
=top='s attractive and more capable cousin.

Here's =top= (running on my laptop):

#+NAME: top-demo-gif
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<figure>
    <img src="../assets/devops-bag-of-tricks/top-demo.gif" alt="Screencast of top" />
    <figcaption>Boring ol' top</figcaption>
</figure>
#+END_EXPORT

I know that I can select which resource to sort by, only because I
bothered to read the man page. But that's about as fancy as top gets.

In contrast, here's htop. I have never consulted the man page for
htop, because I've never felt the need to. The UI is intuitive and
holds your hand every step of the way by giving you a menu of
available keys. It even has a built-in help section.

#+NAME: htop-demo-gif
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<figure>
    <img src="../assets/devops-bag-of-tricks/htop-demo.gif" alt="Screencast of htop" />
    <figcaption>htop!</figcaption>
</figure>
#+END_EXPORT

In case that's hard to follow, here's a quick breakdown of everything
happening in that .gif:

1. The initial view is a flat view of processes sorted by CPU usage,
   which is the default. Notice that the memory usage, swap usage, and
   the load on each CPU is charted in the top-left corner.
2. I press <F5>, which switches the display from a flat list of
   processes sorted by resource usage to a tree view, which displays
   the full process tree rooted at PID 1.
3. I press <F4> to filter, then start typing "firefox" to
   incrementally filter the process tree. I'm left with only firefox
   and all of its descendants.
4. I press the "s" key to begin tracing system calls for the firefox
   process with =strace= (more on that below).
5. I escape the strace session and press the "l" key to view all of
   firefox's open file handles with =lsof= (more on that later, too).
6. I press <F4> to filter the list of file handles owned by the
   firefox process, then start typing "log" to match only files whose
   name contains that string.

Amazing, huh?

I get it, breaking up is hard to do. But don't cry over the good times
you and top had together - smile because they happened, and then move
on with htop.

* Inspecting individual processes

Now you've narrowed your focus to a specific process. Here are a few
techniques to see how it interacts with its environment.

** Where are the logs for this process?

I've got Spotify running on my laptop. Let's see if it does any
logging...

handle open for writing.

Yep, those are log files. Let's check out those leveldb logs. Side
note: leveldb is a library implementation of a kv-store. It looks like
Spotify is using it to store some data locally on disk. Here's some
ad-targeting configuration it's keeping on me:

** What are its environment variables?

It's sometimes useful to inspect a process' environment variables to
verify that it has been launched with the correct =$PATH=, secret
keys, log configuration, etc. Environment variables are exposed via
the /proc filesystem on Linux, so you can read the (null-separated)
contents of =/proc/$pid/environ= like any other text files.

For example, we can inspect the environment variables used by firefox.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output
cat /proc/$(pidof -s firefox)/environ | tr '\0' '\n' | egrep -v "GDM|GTK|LD_" | head -15

** Where are its config files located?

If you're able to launch the process, you can put it under a
microscope with =strace= (or on OSX, =dtruss=) and trace all of its
system calls.

Let's say you can't remember from where Firefox loads user
settings. You could fire up =dtruss= and tell it to wait for a process
named "firefox".

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
strace firefox 2>&1 | tee /tmp/firefox-syscalls.txt
#+END_SRC

Give the process a few seconds to initialize, then check the syscalls:

Some of those are recognizable. For instance, [[https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/174717?hl=en][1e100.net is Google]]. Get
it? (It's scientific notation). Lastpass I recognize - don't know why
it needs to keep a connection open to home, but good to know that it's
using HTTPS, I guess.

What about that first IP address? It's an HTTPS connection, so it
should be curlable...

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output
curl https://151.101.1.69
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Ah right, I have a StackOverflow tab open (of course I do). What about
that random EC2 instance?

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output
curl https://ec2-50-112-164-16.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: curl: (51) SSL: certificate subject name (push.services.mozilla.com) does not match target host name 'ec2-50-112-164-16.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com'

Looks like something that's sending me push notifications from
Mozilla. Interesting...

* Networking

All of the techniques described below were honed by a process
consisting of banging my head against the keyboard, sifting through
StackExchange answers, and re-reading the AWS docs on EC2 security
groups for what felt like the hundredth time.

I am not a networking expert and there are probably smarter ways to do
half of this stuff.

Disclaimer done, let's get to it.

** What's my IP address?

List all network interfaces:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output
ifconfig -l
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: lo0 gif0 stf0 XHC20 en0 p2p0 awdl0 en1 en2 bridge0 utun0

Find the IP address for a given interface:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output
ifconfig en0 | grep inet
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: inet6 fe80::407:3265:b168:386d%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x5
: inet 192.168.1.2 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255

** What's the IP address for this hostname?

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output
dig google.com
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

#+end_example

So "google.com" resolves to 172.217.3.206 - or at least this time it
did. Curiously, =google.com= does not resolve to a consistent IP
address. Let's repeat the lookup and see what we get back:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session none :async t
for i in {1..25}; do dig +short google.com sleep 1; done | sort | uniq -c
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
|  9 | 172.217.14.206 |
|  2 |  172.217.3.174 |
| 13 |  172.217.3.206 |
|  1 |  216.58.193.78 |

Interesting - it looks like Google uses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS][round-robin DNS]].

** What's the hostname for this IP address?

Using a randomly selected IP address for google.com (see above), let's
use dig with the =-x= flag to do a reverse DNS lookup.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output
dig -x 172.217.3.206 +short
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: sea15s12-in-f14.1e100.net.
: sea15s12-in-f206.1e100.net.
: sea15s12-in-f14.1e100.net.
: sea15s12-in-f206.1e100.net.

Huh. That's interesting. We got back 4 hostnames for that IP address, two of
which appear to be duplicates for some reason. As a sanity check,
let's do a forward-lookup on those hostnames...

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
dig +short sea15s12-in-f206.1e100.net
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 172.217.3.206

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
dig +short sea15s12-in-f14.1e100.net
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 172.217.3.206

Yep, same IP, two different hostnames. I'm not sure _why_ Google is
doing this, but creating multiple A records that point to the same IP
is a totally valid thing to do.

** Can I reach someone at this IP address?

The =ping= utility comes in handy when you need to debug why one
machine can't connect to another, usually in a cloud-based environment
with some sort of firewall or virtual network. Any time I have two EC2
instances in a VPC that should be talking to each other but aren't, I
use =ping= to test whether the server is routable from the client.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

** Is anyone listening on this port?

=ping= will tell you whether you have a route to a given machine, but
that doesn't always mean that you can connect to process listening on
a specific port. Once I've used =ping= to confirm that the server I'm
trying to connect to is routable, I use =netcat= to check whether the
given port is exposed to the client. If it isn't, you usually need to
go update some firewall configuration (in EC2, the problem is usually
your security group settings).

** SSH tunneling

Editorial note: I was considering trying to illustrate the various
configurations for SSH tunnels until I came across [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/46235/how-does-reverse-ssh-tunneling-work/118650#118650][How does reverse
SSH tunneling work?]] on unix.stackexchange. The answer from [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/31673/erik][user erik]]
has the best pictorial explanation I can imagine, so I'm just going to
link to [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/118650][his answer]] here and include his diagram inline.

SSH tunnels are an invaluable tool to circumvent firewalls. That
sounds devious, but there are plenty of legitimate reasons to do this
that won't get you fired or trigger an FBI investigation.

*** Forward tunneling

For example, let's say you've got a Java process running in a staging
environment that keeps crashing, and you want to connect your IDE's
debugger to the remote JVM's debug port in order to troubleshoot.

Obviously you don't want to expose the debug port to the entire world,
so leaving a hole in the firewall for this port is a bad idea.
Instead, you can set up an SSH tunnel to securely forward traffic from
your laptop to the debug port on the staging machine. The effect is
that your Java debugger running on your laptop will connect to an
address like localhost:8000, and the SSH daemon will forward the
traffic to the debug port on the staging machine.

Another common use-case for (forward) SSH tunnels is connecting to an
administrative web UI which is bound to localhost on a remote
server. With an SSH tunnel, you can setup an SSH tunnel that forwards
localhost:8000 to the appropriate port on localhost of the remote
server, fire up your browser, and view the web page from your laptop
at localhost:8000.

Forward SSH tunnels look like this:

#+NAME: ssh-tunnel-forward
#+BEGIN_EXPORT html

    </figcaption>
</figure>
#+END_EXPORT

Notice that there are 3 hosts involved in that second diagram. This
type of tunneling is common in environments where SSH access is
mediated through a "gateway." I've also heard this referred to as a
"bastion" or "jump node." The idea is that only the gateway machine is
routable from the outside world, and to log in to a machine on the
private network you have to SSH via the gateway.

*** Reverse tunnel

The diagram above describes regular ol' SSH tunnels, in which a local
port forwards to a remote port. But you can also create tunnels that
work in the opposite direction, in which a remote port forwards
traffic to a local port. I use remote tunnels less frequently, but
there are times when they are useful.

Here's a hypothetical (and somewhat contrived) scenario. Let's say you
want to intercept traffic that's intended for some other machine -
maybe you want to see how clients are calling some server. You fire up
netcat on your laptop with =nc -l 8000=. This just binds a listener to
localhost port 8000 and prints anything it receives on stdout.

Next, you log into the remote machine and shut down the real server
process (to free up its port). Now you can establish a reverse SSH
tunnel from your laptop to the server such that requests to the server
are forwarded "back" to your laptop, like this: =ssh -R
8000:localhost:<remote-port> <remote-ip>=
