This is a story about hubris and intervention in complex systems.

* Introduction

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

-- Genesis 1:3-5
#+END_QUOTE

Back in my Amazon days I worked with a no-nonsense, ex-Army guy named
Ron. One day Ron asked me for a bulk export of some truck schedules,
so I wrote a SQL query and emailed him the results as a .csv. A few
minutes later, he showed up at my desk to ask about the weird number
in the "departure_time" column.

"Ah, right - that's epoch time," I explained.

"Epic time."

"E-poch. It's uh... like, how computers represent time, I guess. That
number is how many seconds have passed since midnight of January 1,
1970."

Ron's blank stare afforded me a few seconds to reflect on how stupid
this idea sounds to anyone who's not a software engineer.

"Oh," he finally said, "of course. 1970: when the world began."

* Act I: Hudson

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Time is merely an artificial standard, which might be
further adjusted if by so doing it could be made more subservient to
our requirements.

-- George Vernon Hudson
#+END_QUOTE

The choice to divide solar days into 24 equal periods is just that: a
choice. If that sounds strange, consider that your MacBook is
currently operating under the assumption that time dawned during the
Nixon administration. Time is an artificial construct, and there's
nothing stopping us from changing it.

George Vernon Hudson recognized this. Hudson was a man of simple
pleasures - namely, astronomy and insects. As a father and the
family's breadwinner, he pursued his hobbies responsibly: he snuck in
an hour of star-gazing before bed and saved his bug-hunting
expeditions for Saturday mornings while the kids were at soccer
practice.

Pscyhe! That's not how you amass "the finest and most perfect
collection of New Zealand insects ever formed by any one
person." [fn:1] What he /actually/ did was mount a one-man campaign to
change the way society keeps time.

Hudson's scheme began from a simple observation: by the time he got
out of bed in the summer, the sun was already up; by the time he
clocked out of his job at the post-office, the sun was already
setting. If everyone were to start their day earlier then they'd have
more daylight in the evenings, which would help them to spot way more
cool bugs. [fn:2]

In 1895 he presented his paper "On Seasonal Time-adjustment in
Countries South of Lat. 30°" before his scientifically-minded peers in
the Wellington Philosophical Society. It didn't get the reception he
was hoping for. In fact, it was so roundly scorned that the Society
didn't even bother to publish it in their proceedings. They did,
however, publish some of the responses to his proposal, a few of which
are too good not to share [fn:3]:

- Mr. Hustwick "was of opinion that the reform spoken of would have to
  wait a little longer." Translation: "Fantastic idea, George, old
  sport! I'll be 100% supportive just as soon as I'm dead enough not
  to be inconvenienced. Let's pencil this one in for right after we
  give rights to the Negroes and Aboriginals people."
- Mr. Harding thought it was "wholly unscientific and impracticable."
- Mr. Travers said it "was out of the question to think of altering a
  system that had been in use for thousands of years, and was found by
  experience to be the best."
- Mr. Richardson thought it "would be a good thing if the plan could
  be applied to the young people." (Huh?)
- Mr. Travers worried that Whippersnapper Time might be confusing, but
  he had a solution: just give every clock two sets of hands.
- Mr. Hawthorne "did not see any difficulty in carrying out the views
  advocated so ably by Mr. Hudson" (Ahh sweet, naïve, Mr. Hawthorne -
  a real, glass-half-full, kinda guy)

Hudson's proposal might have amounted to nothing more than a footnote
on the Wikipedia page of the guy with the biggest bug collection in
New Zealand. But somehow his paper found its way into the hands of an
anonymous True Believer in Christchurch, who found it so inspiring
that they re-printed it and distributed thousands of copies around
town.

Emboldened by the grassroots support, Hudson returned to the
Wellington Philosophical Society in 1898 to refute the most common
objections to seasonal time [fn:1]:

- No, his proposal wouldn't deprive people of long winter evenings,
  because the clocks would only be altered during the summer. (Did you
  even /read/ the paper?)
- Yes, we could all just /agree/ to wake up at 6:00 instead of 7:00
  and show up for the noon train at 11:00, but that's never going to
  happen.
- Yes, the milkman would have to start his route before dawn in the
  early summer. Sorry, milkman.
- Yes, the kerosene company stood to lose some money, but they'd have
  more time for exercise. Can't put a price tag on your health!

No one seems to have been particularly enthused by his second speech,
but at least this time the Society deemed it worthy of publication.

Sir James Hector worried that it would be hard to wake up his boys up
in the morning. "There would also," he fancied, "be some trouble in
getting their domestic helpers to appreciate the change" (That was
thoughtful of Sir James, thinking of the servants like that).

"Mr. Hudson briefly replied," according to the official meeting
minutes, and then they moved on to discussing Sir James' lizard
collection. [fn:4]

And that was pretty much the end of the first campaign for seasonal
time.

* Act II: Willett

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Nevertheless, she persisted."

-- Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell
#+END_QUOTE

The cause languished for the next 9 years until one fateful summer
morning in 1907. William Willett was out for a horseback ride in
suburban London when he noticed that his neighbors' blinds were still
drawn against the sun. This waste of daylight inspired Willett to
write a pamphlet titled, "The Waste of Daylight."

Like Hudson, Willett called for the clocks to be adjusted during the
summer months. Unlike Hudson, who called for a 2-hour spring forward
and a 2-hour fallback, Willett proposed a series of 20 minute
adjustments: 4 in the spring and 4 in the fall. [fn:5]

Willett's pamphlet echoed many of Hudson's talking points. But though
the content was familiar, their rhetorical styles make for a study in
contrast.

Hudson, the gentleman scientist, deployed a measured appeal to logic
with some cheerful pathos thrown in for good measure: wouldn't it be
nice if we had more daylight for nature walks?

Willett, on the other hand, rallied his readers for an assault
on... disease, or something [fn:6]... Here's a representative excerpt:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Light is one of the great gifts of the Creator. While daylight
surrounds us, cheerfulness reigns, anxieties press less heavily, and
courage is bred for the struggle of life. Against our ever-besieging
enemy, disease, light and fresh air act as guards in our defence, and
when the conflict is close, supply us with most effective weapons with
which to overcome the invader.
#+END_QUOTE

With fear sufficiently mongered, Willett closed his pamphlet with a
call to action, urging "every man and woman, and every youth in
particular" to write to their representatives in Parliament in support
of a 6-month trial of seasonal time. [fn:5]

He paid out of pocket to have his pamphlet published and began
distributing copies everywhere he went. Despite his zeal (or maybe
because of it), the proposal didn't immediately gain traction. _The
Spectator_, an influential London weekly, summed up its public
reception: they were "not sanguine of its success."

Let us return to our study in contrast.

When Hudson received "constructive feedback" at his local science
club, he said that "he was sorry to see the paper treated rather with
ridicule. He intended it to be practical," [fn:3] and then went back
to studying butterflies.

When _The Spectator_ was under-enthused by /his/ proposal, Willett
responded with a scathing letter to the editor berating him for his
lack of faith. If he had any hope of being taken seriously, the editor
crushed it; Willet's irate reply appeared in the next issue alongside
a letter from another reader who, for reasons that are unclear, felt
compelled to share his feelings about squirrels. (If you're wondering,
he was really high on the squirrel: "a species of handmaiden" and a
"happy-go-lucky" creature "intending little ill, and if he does offend
at times, his company and capers on the lawn or on the gean-tree or
pear-tree make up for his mischiefs.") [fn:7]

But getting lumped in with squirrel-guy didn't phase Willett. He spent
the next year writing letters, printing pamphlets, and schmoozing with
business leaders and lawmakers. He eventually convinced a member of
the House of Commons to introduce the First Daylight Saving Bill,
which went to a committee tasked with studying its effects. The
ensuing hearings provided Willett with a captive audience - an
opportunity which he thoroughly abused.

The transcript of Willett's testimony is alternately tedious and
hilarious. He starts by asking permission to read a list with the
names of all of his supporters. Mercifully, the Chairman interjects
and after some argument Willett agrees to read only "the principal"
names. "Principal" to Willett evidently meant "at least 84", because
that's how many names he made it through (with frequent stops for
parenthetical asides) before he finally got cut off. [fn:8]

I'll spare you all of the objections to his proposal. Suffice it to
say that there were many, and they make for tedious reading. To give
you a sense of the opposition:

- The Liverpool Cotton Association didn't want to shorten their
  trading window with American markets
- The Director of the Meteorological Office worried that the
  timestamps on meteorological observations would be ambiguous
- The railway manager warned that Willett's proposed 8(!) time changes
  each year would cause mass confusion and delays

Several alternate proposals emerged, too:

- Q: Why not just permanently switch timezones and adopt GMT +1:00?
- A: Because the winter sunrise in London would be after 9:00am.
- Q: Why not just /ask/ everyone to wake up an hour earlier instead of
  changing the clocks?
- A: Because millions of people aren't going to just simultaneously
  and voluntarily change their routines.
- Q: Why do we need 8 clock adjustments per year instead of 2?
- A: Because... well, that's a good question, actually.

Even Willett's supporters didn't agree with him on this last
point. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (yep, that Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle [fn:9]), testified that "it struck me on simply reading it that
a single alteration of an hour would be a round number, and cause less
confusion and attain almost the same result."

But Willett was insistent: the body could absort a 20 minute loss of
sleep, but a full hour would be a shock to the system. And in the
inevitable mixups following a clock adjustment, being 20 minutes early
or late to an appointment would be less catastrophic than a full hour.

His objections were noted but overruled. The committee's final report
to the House of Commons recommended that Britain adopt two 1-hour
alteration of the clocks: one in April and one in September.

A promising, young politician named Winston Churchill, then the
President of the Board of Trade, "read the report of this committee
with much interest and with a lively recognition" of the Bill's
advantages. [fn:10] Unfortunately for Willett, Prime Minister Herbert
Asquith took a less lively view of the bill's advantages and dismissed
it before it could even be discussed. [fn:11]

Really, Herbert? Would it have killed you to say something sooner?
Like, /before/ everyone spent 8 weeks discussing the best time of day
to harvest plums?

Willett being Willett, he responded by writing a letter to the
editor - 400 editors, in fact, of every newspaper he could find -
soliciting support for seasonal time. In 1909 he won over a member of
the House of Commons who agreed to introduce a revised Daylight Saving
Bill which dropped the controversial 20-minute adjustments in favor of
the 1-hour adjustments recommended by the committee.

Several representatives who had been on the 1908 Committee were
understandably less-than-enthused by the prospect of another visit
from Willett. They hastily moved to squash the bill before it could be
read, and probably would have succeeded had Winston Churchill not
rescued it with the type of rousing speech for which he would soon
become famous.

Churchill touted the many benefits that could be gotten in exchange
for an "extra yawn some morning in April, an extra snooze some morning
in September." He urged his colleagues to refer the bill to committee
(again) and his motion passed. (In the cinema of my imagination,
Churchill shouts an "extra snooze some morning in September!" over a
triumphant crescendo of horns, followed by a raucous chorus of cheers
in the House of Commons.) [fn:12]

So once again Willett found himself with a captive audience. And once
again, he made everyone miserable. By way of greeting the Chairman
told Willett, "I had better ask you at once to state, /as shortly as
you can/, the fresh evidence you have to place before the Comittee in
regard to this Bill?"

Of course he totally ignored the qualifier "as shortly as you can" and
launched into reading from an enormous stack of letters. He made it
abundantly clear that he was unhappy with the 1-hour adjustments, and
would prefer to "effect his alteration in the habits of forty odd
millions of people... [with] the thin of the wedge... and not the
thick end first." [fn:13]

The second set of hearings were much like the first: tedious and
divisive. They got hung up on all the same arguments as the first
committee: why not just adopt a different time-zone? Why not just wake
up earlier? Was a 1-hour adjustment better than several smaller ones?
And most importantly, will the women mind waking up an hour earlier to
make tea?

Side-note: this part of the transcript makes for hilarious reading: a
roomful of men arguing over how womankind will react, as if they were
discussing an inscrutable, alien, race with a collective mind whose
inner-workings can only be guessed at. Given the time period I guess
it's no surprise that no one thought to just ask some women. Or, even
more unthinkable: perhaps the men could make their own tea?

The committee met 16 times over nearly 5 months. They ultimately
concluded that due to the "great diversity of opinion... your
Committee recommend that the Bill be not further proceeded
with." [fn:14]

Willett spent the rest of his life campaigning for seasonal
time. Every year from 1911 to 1914, his allies in the legislature
proposed the bill, and every year Asquith's Government refused to hear
it. [fn:15]

Willett died of the flu one year later in March 1915 at age 58.

For a guy obsessed with time-keeping, his timing really sucked.

* Act III: Total War

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You never want a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by
that, it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do
before.

-- Rahm Emanuel, former White House Chief of Staff
#+END_QUOTE

Ironically, the "invaders" that Willett warned about in his pamphlet
were the first to adopt his proposal. Germany adopted seasonal time
just 14 months after Willett's death. The British House of Commons
passed Willett's Daylight Saving Bill a week later.

Votes in favor? 120. Votes against? 2.

2!

If you were paying attention in your history class, you'll recall that
there was a war going on by the time the bill passed in 1916. At the
beginning of WWI, the Liberal British government's policy was
"Business As Usual." As you were, citizenry! Just a bit of war,
nothing to fret about!

But it's hard to stay nonchalant with a giant zeppelin dropping bombs
in your backyard, which is what London was dealing with by the spring
of 1915 [fn:16]. The flood of innovation and mechanization that
carried over from the Industrial Revolution resulted in a sort of
Cambrian explosion of killing machines: in addition to zeppelins, the
Great War also marked the battlefield-debut of chlorine gas,
"aeroplanes", barbed wire, tanks, submarines, and machine guns.

Once human ingenuity turned towards the problem of how to kill as
efficiently as possible, we traded bayonets for machine guns and heavy
artillery. The results were devastating. The British lost more men on
the first day of the Battle of the Somme than they did during the
entirety of the Second Boer War, just 14 years earlier - 57,000 men
/in one day/. [fn:17] [fn:18] For a more modern comparison, the United
States spent 9 years fighting in Iraq and suffered less than 37,000
casualties [fn:19].

All this to say, "Business as Usual" didn't last long. It was followed
by the policy of "Total War," which overhauled society and reoriented
the economy around wartime manufacturing. Running a bomb factory
requires energy, and by May of 1916 the British empire needed all the
energy it could get. Voting against a wartime energy-saving measure
wouldn't have been a good look, politically, so opposition to seasonal
time evaporated.

And so for all of Willett's pamphlet-publishing and proselytizing and
wining-and-dining of politicians, in the end all it took was the
outbreak of the bloodiest war in human history.

* Interlude: On Hubris and Conviction

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Who could anticipate or provide for such a succession of hopes and
schemes? Only an unimaginative man would think he could; only an
arrogant man would want to.

-- Jane Jacobs
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here's part of what fascinates me about this story.

When I start speaking, I have an internal timer that begins counting
down from ~10 seconds - a little more if I'm with friends, a little
less if I'm in front of a big or unfamiliar group. Once that timer
expires, all I hear is a blaring alarm warning me to STOP TALKING
IMMEDIATELY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD so that everyone in the room will look
/anywhere/ besides at me.

Willett clearly didn't have a timer.

Or sometimes at work I'll be asked to weigh on in some unsettled
question. Every once in a while, a weird and scary thing happens:
people actually listen to my argument and change their minds. As soon
as I recognize that I'm being persuasive, I have to quell a sense
self-defeating panic: are they really listening critically, or are
they just acquiesing because of our relative positions in a
mostly-arbitrary corporate hierarchy? Maybe I don't have enough
information to have an informed opinion. What if I'm missing some
crucial bit of context? How should I qualify my opinion to reflect my
level of uncertainty? How culpable am I now for the outcome of this
decision???

I can't imagine Willett having this internal monologue. I'm fully
aware that I'm an outlier on the introspective/introverted tail of the
personality spectrum, probably to an unhealthy degree, but I'm still
amazed that people like Willett exist.

Where did he get the conviction? Opponents of seasonal time emerged
from every sector of society. This should have been a strong signal
that tampering with something so fundamental to modern society would
have ripple-effects that he couldn't anticipate. Did he ever have
doubts? Or was his outward bluster a reflection of perfect
inner-tranquility?

In my experience, this type of irrational and totally unfounded level
of self-assurance is disproportionately common in two groups of
people: lunatics and rich white guys. Willett was a card-carrying
member of both.

Ok, fine, "lunatic" may be overstating it, but not by much. Remember
when he chastised the editor of _The Spectator_ for being "less than
sanguine" of Willett's success? The editor who printed Willett's
letter alongside Squirrel Guy? Here's a representative excerpt of his
letter:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Are these words quite worthy of the Spectator? ... [I]t is clear that
we have passed the Slough of Despond. We are now climbing the Hill
Difficulty. The Palace Beautiful awaits us at the top. Mistrust and
Timorous will never reach it! Surely the "Great Heart" of the
Spectator should encourage pilgrims to climb the Hill, and should use
every weapon he can against any Grims that may bar the way or any
lions that may appear to forbid the happy arrival of the Bill before
his Majesty the King. What is there to fear? [fn:7]
#+END_QUOTE

Contrast _that_ response to critism with Hudson's closing remarks at
the Wellington Philosophical Society, in which he basically said,
"Well, shucks, I thought it was a good idea. Sorry for wasting your
time," then fled home to stargaze and eat Ben and Jerry's straight out
of the carton.

That's Timorous for you! Throwing down his weapons and abandoning the
pilgrimage to the Palace Beautiful at the first sign of a few lions
and Grims!

Hudson is the kind of person who, when he has to send an email with
more than 3 recipients, rereads it at least 10 times and has to google
the rules regarding semicolon usage before clicking send; Willett is
the guy who hits reply-all to 300 people and dashes off the first
thing that pops into his head, ignoring all those red and green
squiggles because he's pretty sure the word 'lose' has two 'o's -
thanks anyway, spell-check!

The depressing thing is that Willett's (over)confidence was effective
and maybe even rational. Hudson's healthy sense of humility got him
nowhere; Willett's total lack of humility took him pretty far.
Without an irrational level of self-belief, he would have abandoned
his campaign after his 100th un-answered letter to the editor.

Imagine if Willett had been intellectually honest and said, "Gosh, you
raise a good point, Farmer Ben - I /hadn't/ taken the shelf-life of
gooseberries into account. I concede that altering our society's
timekeeping practices will affect our lives and our children's lives
in ways that no one in this room can possibly anticipate. Some effects
may be harmful, but given the limited information that's available to
us, I think it's more likely than not that seasonal time will be a net
positive. So whaddya say, gang? Who's with me?"

No one obviously - he would have been bullied out of the room by some
farmer or railroad operator who was just as irrationally opposed to
DST as Willett was in favor of it.

In fact, there's some evidence that he began with a healthy skepticism
and was forced to abandon it along the way: his original pamphlet
called for a 6-month trial of DST. But when asked if he believed the
Bill could be passed on a trial basis, the contradiction in his
response was telling. "Yes," he said, "but then you immediately impart
an element of doubt, and you cannot expect the House of Commons, I
should think, to justify a Bill at all with an element of doubt in
it."

But even more depressing is that Willett's overconfidence seems to
have been necessary but insufficient: his bill didn't actually pass
until society was leveled by the most horrifying and pointless war in
modern history.

As a group, humans hate radical changes. And historically this
aversion to boat-rocking has served us well: we've never eaten that
potentially poisonous berry before, so why start now? Remember the
great harvest we had after we did the rain dance last year? Let's get
to dancing.

When things are good, society has a lot of inertia. When things are
bad, we suddenly become a lot more willing to experiment. The Patriot
Act would have been inconceivable on September 10th, 2001; a national
speed limit of 55 mph would never have passed without the oil crisis
of 1973; it took Pearl Harbor to get the United States into WWII; the
idea of women working in factories was unthinkable before WWI, but
somebody had to build the bombs that the men were busy
dropping.

If you've been taking notes on how to effect change, the formula so
far is:

1. Delude yourself and others to build influence.
2. Wait for tragedy to strike, and then...
3. Exploit the ensuing chaos to secure your objective before anyone
   can object.

Sorry, kid. The world is an icky place.

* Act IV: Today

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.

-- The Second Coming, W.B. Yeats
#+END_VERSE

The United States followed Britain in adopting seasonal time for the
duration of WWI, reinstituted it year-round in the aftermath of Pearl
Harbor, and then dropped it again in 1945. Absent a federal standard,
a patchwork of DST adoption emerged across the country. By 1966
everyone was thoroughly confused, so the Uniform Time Act mandated DST
as the standard (the law does allow states to opt-out, but as of 2020
only Arizona and Hawaii have done so [fn:20]).

Between 2002 and 2005, the average price of a regular unleaded gallon
of gas in the US nearly tripled, soaring to almost
$3.00 [fn:21]. Average Joe was unhappy, so Congress put on its
collective concerned face and passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

A politician would probably call this bill "comprehensive". A normal
person who bothered to read its 11 page table of contents would
probably call it a schizophrenic, kitchen-sink of a bill. Among other
things, it proposed to:

- Invest $200 million into coal (the energy of the future!)
- Authorize tax credits for wind energy producers (just in case the
  coal doesn't work out, for some reason)
- Arm security personnel at nuclear plants with machine guns
- Fund a scholarship on behalf of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
- Exempt fracking companies from the protections in the Safe Drinking
  Water Act (Totally reasonable. Nothing to see here!)
- Cut royalties that oil companies are obligated to pay the federal
  government to incentivize deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico
- Commission a study on the benefits of telecommuting for federal
  employees

And, oh yeah, it would also extend Daylight Savings Time by 1
month [fn:22].

Unsurprisingly, a lot of people hated the idea, including the
Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United Synagogue of
Conservative Judaism, who opposed the extension on the grounds that no
one wants to go to church before the sun is up in the spring. The head
of the National Parent Teacher Association warned that children
walking to school were at increased risk of being mowed down by cars
and kidnapped in the morning darkness.[fn:23]

Stop me if you've heard this one: a priest, a rabbi, and a school
teacher walk into the door of their congressman's office.

That's it - that was the joke.

They walk /into/ a closed door, because their representative is in his
office drinking scotch with the lobbyist from the sporting goods
industry who just delivered a check made out to his re-election
campaign and oh-by-the-way just so happens to think seasonal time is
great for America.

Forget it, it was funny in my head.

To the chagrine of clergymen and the delight of Dick's Sporting Goods
shareholders, George Dubya signed the bill on August 8th, 2005. But
the bill included an uncharacteristically sensible provision: it
required the Department of Energy to report back on the effect of
extending Daylight Saving Time.

The DoE put a few Ph.D's on it and 3 years later they came back with
their findings. An extra month of Daylight Savings Time /does/ save
energy - 17 Trillion Btu of it.

"Hooo-wee, that's a whole-buncha Btus!" you're probably thinking.

But it's not; the US consumed 101,000 trillion Btu in 2007. In other
words, Extended Daylight Saving Time resulted in total energy savings
of 0.02%. [fn:24] Which admittedly isn't great, but it gets worse.

A 2008 study examined the effects of DST in Indiana, which until 2006
was unique in that only certain counties in the state practiced
DST. The presence of a naturally occurring treatment and control group
made the Hoosier state the perfect place to study the effect of
seasonal time on energy consumption.

Incidentally, "Indiana, the perfect place to study the effect of
seasonal time on energy consumption," would be a better state motto
than "The Crossroads of America." Or how about, "Indiana: We apologize
for Mike Pence." You can have those for free, Indiana Department of
Tourism.

Anyways, the authors of the study concluded that not only did DST not
save energy - it actually /increased/ energy consumption by 1%! What
happened?

Air-conditioning, mostly. In Willett's day, residential energy
consumption in the summer was driven by the demand for electric
lighting. Now it's driven by air-conditioning, and people returning
home from work an hour earlier means an extra hour of running the AC
at full blast. [fn:25]

And if the most serious problem with DST were air-conditioner usage in
Indiana, The Atlantic wouldn't be running articles with titles like,
"[[https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/11/daylight-saving-time-americas-greatest-shame/354753/][Daylight Saving Time Is America's Greatest Shame]]."

Huh. Greatest shame... really? Genocide against the indigenous
population, slavery, Japanese internment camps - fine, not our
proudest moments. But according to the Atlantic, our barbaric
timekeeping practices are what send America ducking behind the cereal
display whenever it spots Sweden in the supermarket.

Looking past the ridiculous headline, the article does reflect a
growing resentment for seasonal time. [[https://www.petition2congress.com/ctas/end-daylight-savings-time][This petition]] to abolish DST
currently has over 380,000 signatures from concerned citizens like
"steve k.", who urges lawmakers to "stop daylight time right now do it
right now its too much for florida get it out of florida."

Or this thoughtful Texan, who writes, "PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE LEAVE IT
AT DAY LIGHT SAVINGS YEAR AROUND. NO SINCE IN FALLING BACK FOR A FEW
MONTHS. YOU KEEP DAY LIGHT SAVINGS SO LONG PEOPLE THING STANDARD TIME
IS THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Someone from Cascade, IA warns "Please end daylight savings
time.. it's always even more later than you think!" Yikes. What does
Someone from Cascade, IA know that we don't?

"Please listen to all the voices," says Someone from Alpharetta,
Georgia, "and end this chaos in the name of saving energy! We are not
magically creating an hour of daylight by changing our clocks by an
hour! We're creating chaos that we don't need in the world."

As a general rule, when someone urges me to do something at the behest
of "the voices," I do not do that thing. However, in this case,
Someone from Alpharetta, Georgia, has a point: DST does create
chaos. Twice a year, every year, we reset our clocks and brace for:

- Thousands of traffic fatalities [fn:26]
- A 3-5% increased risk of heart attack every March [fn:27]
- Countless lifetimes of prison sentences issued by grumpy,
  sleep-deprived judges [fn:28]
- A 5.7% increase in workplace injuries each March [fn:29]
- Nearly half of a billion dollars in lost productivity annually in
  the United States alone [fn:30]

Ironically, the one person who foresaw all of this was DST's biggest
supporter: Willett. He warned everyone repeatedly that a 1-hour time
change would be too great a shock for fragile meat-sacks like us to
cope with, and he was right. Every March during the week following the
time change, sleep deprivation makes us do dumb things like wrap our
cars around telephone poles and eat enough Hardee's french fries to
power an NFL stadium for 34 hours. (Gross but true, see [[*Appendix][Appendix]]).

Defenders of DST argue that, sure, sleep-deprived motorists crash more
often during one week in March, but on aggregate DST makes our
highways safer by reducing the number of cars on the road after
dark. But that argument has been pretty convincingly refuted; sleep
deprivation has a much stronger effect on crash risk than ambient
light, and even the small effect of ambient light merely shifts
crashes from the sunnier evenings to the darker mornings. [fn:25]

It's increasingly clear that DST's days are numbered. The EU has
already voted to permanently adopt summer time starting in 2021. The
situation in the United States is a bit tricky: while each state does
have the right to opt-out of seasonal time, they do not have the right
to choose a different time zone, which is exactly what most states
want to do by adopting "year-round" Daylight Saving Time.

Year-round DST has its merits, but comments like the one from Someone
from Alpharetta, GA ("We are not magically creating an hour of
daylight by changing our clocks by an hour!") cause me to worry that
some people don't really understand what they're asking for. So before
we consign seasonal time to the scrap-heap of history, let's look at
how it actually works...

* Act V: Tomorrow

#+BEGIN_VERSE
  Chairman: I rather gather from what you have said that your ideal
            method of making the change would be - if by a miracle
            every clock and every watch could be made to gain a minute
            a day?
  Willett:  Half a minute almost would do it.
  Chairman: Gain a minute a day beginning in the beginning of April, and
            get half an hour fast by July, and then lose a minute each
            day afterwards, and get right on the 1st of October?
  Willett:  Yes.
  Chairman: That would be your idea of perfection?
  Willett:  Yes.
  Chairman: But, of course, that is impossible?
  Willett:  Of course, that is impossible.
#+END_VERSE

Let's get one thing out of the way: the people who argue, "If Daylight
Saving Time is so great, why don't we have it the whole year?" are
fundamentally missing the value proposition of seasonal time.

The Earth has a tilted axis and orbits the Sun in an ellipse; this is
why we have seasons, and it's also why the days are longer in the
summer. The chart below shows when the sun rises and sets in local,
solar time [fn:31] at varying latitude throughout the year.

Notice that the length of the day depends on just two variables: the
day of the year and the latitude. Time zones, which are demarcated by
longitude, determine the hour of sunrise and sunset but have no effect
on the length of the day. So go ahead, join the time zone to your
east - just know that you're opting in to a pre-dawn commute to work
in the winter.

Let's choose a fixed location on that chart above - say, Seattle,
Washington. Here's how the length of the day changes throughout the
year:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <img src="../assets/willett-time/standard-daylight-hours.png"/>
#+END_EXPORT

Let's arbitrarily pick 6:30 am as the ideal hour for sunrise. In the
graph above, the entire dark-yellow region below the horizontal line
at ~y=6:30~ is "wasted" daylight.

Now let's add DST:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <img src="../assets/willett-time/dst-daylight-hours.png"/>
#+END_EXPORT

We've reclaimed most of that "wasted" daylight, but the curve has
these ugly discontinuities in March and November. These are the
Sleep-Deprivation Death Zones in which the lucky people get sleepy and
grouchy for a week or so and the unlucky people get dead, forever.

So DST kills people, but no DST wastes daylight. Can we have it both
ways? Technically, yeah - we could.

In Willett's day, adjusting non-networked, mechanical clocks was a
hassle; today we have iPhones. If they wanted to, Apple could push out
an update tomorrow that "springs-forward" by a few seconds every
day. The time would change, but it would happen so gradually that we
wouldn't even notice. Here's how it would look:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  <img src="../assets/willett-time/willet-time-daylight-hours.png"/>
#+END_EXPORT

See? No wasted daylight, and no perceptible clock adjustments.

In a previous draft of this post, I made a whole-hearted pitch for
this idea, the irony of which was not lost on me. But whatever system
we adopt next will undoubtedly kill people in both predictable and
unpredictable ways, and I just don't have the appetite for it.

I'm more of a Hudson, so I'll leave the campaign for continuous
seasonal time to a Willett and return to my bugs - specifically, the
ones in [[https://github.com/astahlman/willet-time][this Github repository]]. It has has the source code for all of
the charts and the clock at the top of this page (artwork courtesy of
[[https://www.gabriellebat.es/][Gabrielle Bates]]), which shows the time at Willett's home in Pett's
Wood under continous seasonal time ("Willett Time" has a nice ring to
it, don't you think?)

My bug collection is (hopefully) smaller and (definitely) less
interesting than Hudson's. He painted over 3500 insects and they are
painfully beautiful. Here's one from _New Zealand Moths and
Butterflies_ which was published in 1898, the same year that he spoke
before the Wellington Philosophical Society.

  <img src="assets/willett-time/New_Zealand_Moths_and_Butterflies_(1898)_06.jpg"/>
#+END_EXPORT html

So here's to the reformers: to Willett, and to whoever takes up his
mantle and undoes what he did. May your outcomes be as good as your
intentions.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Reading the debates which took place in Parliament on daylight saving
in 1908, 1909, and 1911, one marvels that so feeble a case should have
been sustained so long, and that a measure whose effect has been to
enlarge the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness
among the millions of people who live in this country should have met
with so frigid a reception. Let us, then, as we put forward our clocks
for another summer, drink a silent toast to the memory of William
Willett, who spared neither labour nor money over a long period of his
life in his advocacy of this great reform. He did not live to see
success crown his unselfish efforts; he died in 1915, a year before
the passing of the wartime Act. But he has the monument he would have
wished in the thousands of playing-fields crowded with eager young
people every fine evening throughout the summer and one of the finest
epitaphs that any man could win: He gave more light to his countrymen.

[fn:6] This may have been less deranged than it sounds, out of
context. If Europe at the turn of the century was a keg party, then
Germany was like that red-faced guy making everyone uneasy with
progressively louder and more confrontational proclamations of his
naval superiority (it's been a while since I've been to a keg
party). So it's possible the martial metaphor may have been less
jarring to his contemporaries - but still, a bit much.
